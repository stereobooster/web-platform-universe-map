# Web Platform Universe Map

**Disclaimer** work in progress

Web platform - collection of technologies powering modern web. The problem is that there is no single standard or opinion on what it is. There are a lot of committees, working groups and organisation. There are a lot technologies. There are a lot of aspects and opinions.

## Purpose

Purpose of this project is to map all existing standards, initiatives and ideas and their relations to each other.

## TODO

- Started doing this project with Jekyll, because thought it was requirement for github pages. Later remembered that github pages can serve static files. Switch to Gulp and html5poilerplate (I guess).
