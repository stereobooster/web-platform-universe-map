# Web Platform Universe Map

**Disclaimer** work in progress

Web platform - collection of technologies powering modern web. The problem is that there is no single standard or opinion on what it is. There are a lot of committees, working groups and organisation. There are a lot technologies. There are a lot of aspects and opinions.

## Purpose

Purpose of this project is to map all existing standards, initiatives and ideas and their relations to each other.

## TODO

- Add clusterization and collision detection
- Add about project section
- Use YAML and Markdown for graph data
- Move all SVG styles to sass
- Add animation to bring selected node to center
- Save selected node via anchor in url
- Add deprication flags to nodes
- Add status link (like caniuse)
- Add other links
- Add search
- Add standardjs
- Add social tags (title, description, image), github badge, add share buttons
- Add about project section
- Test on mobile/touchscreen devices
- Node types: idea, standard, library (polyfill)
- Started doing this project with Jekyll, because thought it was requirement for github pages. Later remembered that github pages can serve static files. Switch to Gulp and html5poilerplate (I guess).
- prerender D3 on server?
